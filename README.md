### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I received PhD in biochemistry in the University of Fribourg, Switzerland and I'm currently doing a PostDoc in the [Marc Robinson-Rechavi](https://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home/menuinst/people/group-leaders/prof-marc-robinson-rechavi.html) group at the Department of Ecology and Evolution in the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.

I'm working in Marc's group as a data scientist/bioinformatician in the [Bgee](https://bgee.org) team.

My task in Bgee team is to analyse/integrate single cell transcriptomics data from different platforms as well as to contribute to the maintenance of the pipeline together with other Bgee members.

I use mainly R for data analysis and visualization.

The pipelines workflows (mainly for Bgee) are writing using make.
